# Schedule 6

SSchedule 6 is a timetable, and task manager application. Users are able to import their calendars, add, edit, and delete events on the timetable. The To-do list enables users to create, edit, and delete tasks.

Students can use this application to enter class schedules, events, and assignments in order to keep track of their tasks. With this program, students are able to access all of their calendar events and tasks from one place and across multiple devices.

# Project installation
## Mac User Font Download
Mac users need to download a font in order for the program to display properly. To do so, download the [Gill Sans MT Condensed font](https://www.dafontfree.net/gill-sans-mt-condensed-regular/f64848.htm). To add the font into the system, open Font Book through spotlight search (command + space) and find the plus button to add a new font. This will pull up a Finder window where the downloaded font can be selected and opened. Gill Sans MT Condensed will appear in the “User” section of Font Book

## Dashboard
![Picture of schedule](image/schedule.png)
After logging in, the dashboard as seen above will show up. This dashboard contains the users timetable and to-do list. The first time a user logs in, both the timetable and to-do list will be empty, but an existing user who already has events and tasks saved, will see those same events and tasks show up on the timetable and to-do list when they log back in.
## Events
Users are able to add events in two ways:
1. While in week view, users can directly click on any time of a day, and drag how long they would want their event to be.
2. Click on the “ADD FUTURE EVENT” button on the top right, and a screen would pop up allowing users to input the required info for an event they want to create (as shown below).
